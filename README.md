# MasterBreak

MasterBreak is a very simple game written in Swift.

##Why does it exist
I wrote it to practice the language and published its code so that other people can see it and eventually help me improving it.

##Usage
You can download the code, run it in xCode and sideload it to your iOS device. It was meant to be used on an iPhone or iPod touch running at least iOS 9.

##License
This piece of software is MIT licensed. In case you build something based even if partially on this code, I would be happy if you link to this repository or to [my website](http://controlledflame.com) - although you don't have to.
